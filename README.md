# Il2CppDumper GUI

![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/APd7EyO.png)

This is the simple GUI version of Perfare's Il2CppDumper. The GUI is based on Bunifu Framework because I like dark theme

Support drag and drop binary files and DAT for file selection. APK, APKS, XAPK and decrypted IPA file for auto dump

About code updating, I merge manually using Code compare instead using Github's auto merge, because i didn't know how to use Github back then but I will still do as of today, as I don't have time to learn more about merging

Note that my C# codes are not the best hehe
