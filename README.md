# Il2CppDumper GUI

This is the simple GUI version of Perfare's Il2CppDumper. The GUI is based on Bunifu Framework because I like dark theme

Support drag and drop binary files and DAT for file selection. APK, APKS, XAPK and decrypted IPA file for auto dump

About code updating, I merge manually using Code compare instead using Github's auto merge, and I will still do as of today. I don't have time to learn Git related

Note that my C# skills is not the best
