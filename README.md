# Il2CppDumper GUI

![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/APd7EyO.png)

This is the simple GUI version of Perfare's Il2CppDumper. The GUI is based on Bunifu Framework because I like dark theme.

Support drag and drop binary files and DAT for file selection. APK, APKS, XAPK and decrypted IPA file for auto dump

About code updating, I review and merge manually using Code compare instead using Github's feature, because i didn't know how to use Github back then. I will still do it today, because I don't have time to learn more about merging

Bunifu requires to be paid in order to use. If you don't like Bunifu or can't activate Bunifu, try to find shady versions, you know, or reconstuct the UI with the default WinForm layout, or get the non-bunifu project here https://github.com/T5ive/Il2CppDumper-GUI

Note that my C# codes are not the best hehe

If none of these method helps, maybe do some reversing and decrypt it by yourself
